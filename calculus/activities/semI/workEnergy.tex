\item Suppose that the block in the second question of the pre-class activity is pulled the
  granite grinds off on the bottom. It starts at a mass of 500
  kg. Mass is removed at a constant rate of 2 kg  per meter. Assume
  that the block starts at the origin, $x=0$ and assume that the angle
  is $\alpha=0$. The coefficient of friction is 0.2.

    that it's velocity is constant. That is

\item The block used in the previous activity is examined, and we wish
  to find the amount of work necessary to pull the block at a constant
  speed over a distance of 100m.  Suppose that as the block is pulled
  the granite grinds off on the bottom. It starts at a mass of 500 kg
  and is pulled at a constant velocity. Mass is removed at constant 2 kg per
  meter. Assume that the block starts at the origin, $x=0$ and assume
  that the angle is $\alpha=0$. The coefficient of friction is 0.2.
