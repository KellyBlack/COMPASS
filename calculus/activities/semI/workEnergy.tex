\begin{problem}
\item A block of granite is pulled, and as the granite moves part of
  it grinds off on the bottom. It starts with a mass of 500 kg. Part
  of the mass is removed at a constant rate of 2 kg per meter. Assume
  that the block starts at the origin, $x=0$ and the angle is
  $\alpha=0$. The coefficient of friction is 0.2.

  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Determine the mass of the block given its position.
    \vfill
  \item Determine the amount of force necessary to move the block so
    that it's velocity is constant. That is
    $\frac{d}{dt} \vec{v}(t)$ is zero.
    \vfill
  \item Make a rough sketch of the force as a function of the block's
    position.  \sideNote{ Be sure to label your axes and label all
      important points on your graph.}

    \vfill
  \end{subproblem}

\clearpage

\item Using the same block examined in the previous question, we wish
  to find the amount of work necessary to pull the block at a constant
  speed a distance of 100m. The mass moves at a constant
  velocity. Again, assume that the block starts at the origin, $x=0$
  and assume that the angle is $\alpha=0$. The coefficient of friction
  is 0.2.

  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{ink/week7/dragBlock}

  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Break the distance into five equal lengths across the 100m.
    If you assume that the force is constant over each interval how
    much work is done by the force?  \sideNote{Use the force required
      at the start of each interval.}

    \vfill

  \item Break the distance into ten equal lengths across the 100m.  If
    you assume that the force is constant over each interval how much
    work is done by the force?  \sideNote{Use the force required at
      the start of each interval.}

    \vfill

    \clearpage

  \item Break the distance in twenty equal lengths across the 100m.  If
    you assume that the force is constant over each interval how much
    work is done by the force?
    \sideNote{Use the force required at the start of each interval.}

    \vfill

  \item Briefly explain what is happening with respect to your
    approximations of the work. Are the approximations getting bigger
    or smaller? Are they getting closer to the true amount? What can
    you do to improve the approximation?
