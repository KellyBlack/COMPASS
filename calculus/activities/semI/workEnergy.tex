\begin{problem}
\item Suppose that a block of granite is pulled, and as the
  granite moves part of it grinds off on the bottom. It starts at a mass of 500
  kg. Mass is removed at a constant rate of 2 kg  per meter. Assume
  that the block starts at the origin, $x=0$ and assume that the angle
  is $\alpha=0$. The coefficient of friction is 0.2.

  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Determine the mass of the block given its position.
    \vfill
  \item Determine the amount of force necessary to move the block so
    that it's velocity is constant. That is
    $\frac{d}{dt} \vec{v}(t)$ is zero.
    \vfill
  \item Make a sketch of the force as a function of the block's
    position.
    \sideNote{ Be sure to label your axes and label all important
      points on your graph.}

\item The block used in the previous question is further examined, and we wish
  to find the amount of work necessary to pull the block at a constant
  speed over a distance of 100m.  Suppose that as the block is pulled
  the granite grinds off on the bottom. It starts at a mass of 500 kg
  and is pulled at a constant velocity. Mass is removed at constant 2 kg per
  meter. Assume that the block starts at the origin, $x=0$ and assume
  that the angle is $\alpha=0$. The coefficient of friction is 0.2.

    you assume that the force is constant over each interval how much
    work is done by the force?
