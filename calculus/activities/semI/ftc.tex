\item A rope is attached to an object, and it is pulled at an angle of
  $\frac{\pi}{6}$ from above the horizontal. The object is 3.0 kg, and
  the coefficient of friction is 0.3. The object is pulled for 3
  meters at a constant velocity. How much work was done by the force
  acting on the rope?

\item A block is arranged as shown in the diagram below. The block has
  a mass of 50 kg, and its height, $H$, is 1m.  The coefficient of
  friction between the block and the base it is resting on is 0.2. A
  rope is connected to the block half way up and is hanging over a
  corner that has negligible friction. The right edge of the block is
  initially a distance $d_1=4.0$m from the edge, and it starts from
  rest. A constant tension of 150 N is applied to the rope. \\
