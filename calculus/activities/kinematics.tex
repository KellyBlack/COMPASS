\actTitle{The Relationship Between Velocity and Time}

The average rate of change for a function, $f(t)$, from $t=a$ to $t=b$ is
defined to be 
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Geometrically this is the equivalent to be the slope of the straight
line that goes through the two points. Of the function is the position
of an object, then physically it is the average velocity of an object
between the two times. In this case the units would be distance
divided by time.

\scalebox{0.5}{\input{py/week1/averageRateChange_day2.pgf}}

The numerator can be thought of as the total change in the object's
position over the given change in time. If the object's change in
position is negative then the average rate of change is
negative. Likewise, if the object's change in position is positive
then the average rate of change is positive.
