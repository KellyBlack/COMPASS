\actTitle{The Relationship Between Position and Time}
\begin{problem}
\item Emily decides to take a drive out to the big town. She starts
  out and drives the first hour at a steady 65 mph. After hitting some
  bad traffic it takes her another 30 minutes just to go 10
  miles. Aggravated, she decides to stop off at a McSub Kings for
  lunch which takes another 30 minutes. 

  \sideNote{Assume that Emily's initial position is the origin, 0.)

  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Sketch a graph which shows her distance along the road from
    her starting point as a function of time.  

    \sideNote{Be sure to label your axes and label all important
      points on your graph.}  

    \vfill

    \item Sketch a graph which shows her velocity as a function of
      time.

      \sideNote{ Be sure to label your axes and label all important
        points on your graph.}

      \vfill

    \item Determine Emily's position after one hour from starting.

    \item Determine Emily's position after 90 minutes from starting.
      \vspace{3em}

    \item Determine Emily's position after two hours from starting.
