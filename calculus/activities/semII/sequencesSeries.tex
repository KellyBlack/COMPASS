  \item The index of refraction, $n$, for a material is defined to be
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    n & = & \frac{c}{v},
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum and $v$ is the speed of light within the material.
  When a beam of light moves through one material with an index of refraction $n_1$ and then strikes a second material some of the light is reflected and some of the light passes through the material.
  The first material has an index of refraction given by $n_1$, and the second material has an index of refraction of $n_2$.

A glass lens can be used to make it look as if an object appears in different place. An example is shown in the diagram below.
  A lens has a focal length, $f_1$. An object is sitting a distance $s_1$ to the left of the lens, and the resulting image
  appears to be sitting a distance of $s_2$ from the lens.

      \draw[thin] (3,-1.1) -- (3,-2) node[anchor=north] {$s_2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}

    The relationship between the three variables is
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \label{eqn:lensDistOne}
      \frac{1}{s_1} + \frac{1}{s_2} & = & \frac{1}{f_1}.
    \end{eqnarray}
    In this case the lens is convex on both sides, so if the original object is to the left of the lens then $s_1$ is positive.
    If the image is to the right then $s_2$ is positive as well.

    Now suppose that there are two lenses. We start with the same situation as above, but a second lens is added very close to the first lens as shown in the diagram below.
    The location where the object appears, though, has not changed, and the diagram is not correct. The second lens will change the location of the image that is located at $s_2$.
    Because the image from the first lens is to the right of the new convex lens, the distance is negative. Also, we assume that the lenses are close,
    so the image's distance to the second lens is approximately $-s_2$.

Answer the three questions before class and show your work.

\begin{problem}
\item We will construct an approximation of the function
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    f(x) & = & \cos(x).
  \end{eqnarray*}
  The approximation is a polynomial that is defined by
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    p(x) & = & a + b x + c x^2,
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.
  Determine values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ so that $p_2(\pi)=f(\pi)$,
  $p_2'(\pi)=f'(\pi)$, and $p_2''(\pi)=f''(\pi)$.
\begin{subproblem}
\item Write out the equation that results from setting $p(\pi)=f(\pi)$.
\vfill
\item Write out the equation that results from setting $p'(\pi)=f'(\pi)$.
\vfill
\item Write out the equation that results from setting $p''(\pi)=f''(\pi)$.
\vfill
\item Solve the system of equations that result from the three previous equations. Solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$.

\end{subproblem}

\item Make a sketch of the functions, $p_2(x)$ and $f(x)$, for $x$ from $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to
  $\frac{3\pi}{2}$. Use your calculator to plot the two functions and
  sketch the result.

  \vfill

\item A function is defined to be
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    h(x) & = & a + b (x-\pi) + c(x-\pi)^2.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  Expand the quadratic term (FOIL) and express the function as a
  polynomial of degree two.

\begin{problem}
\item Suppose we want to construct an approximation of the function
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    f(x) & = & \cos(x).

  To do so a polynomial is defined to be
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    p_2(x) & = & a + b (x-\pi) + c (x-\pi)^2 ,
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.  Determine
  values of $a$, $b$,  and $c$ so that the
  polynomial is the same value and its first through second
  derivatives are the same as those of the function $f(x)=\cos(x)$ when
  $x=\pi$.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Write out the equation that results from setting $p_2(\pi)=f(\pi)$.

  previous question. Plot the function for $x$ from $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to
    $\frac{3\pi}{2}$.

\item A polynomial is defined to be
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    p_4(x) & = &  a_0 + a_1 (x-\pi) +  a_2 (x-\pi)^2 +  a_3 (x-\pi)^3 +  a_4 (x-\pi)^4,
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $a_4$, $a_3$, $a_2$, $a_1$ and $a_0$ are constants.  Determine
  values of $a_4$, $a_3$, $a_2$, $a_1$ and $a_0$ so that the
  polynomial is the same value and its first through fourth
  derivatives are the same as those of the function $f(x)=\cos(x)$ when
  $x=\pi$.

\item Make a sketch of the functions, $p_2(x)$, $p_4(x)$ and $f(x)$,
  from the previous questions. Plot the function for $x$ from $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to

\item Determine a third order polynomial that will approximate $\ln(x)$ at $x=1$.
    Write out the general form for your polynomial and then determine the coefficients that will insure the
    function and its first derivatives match.
