\section{Flux through a surface}
The flux through a surface is defined to be the part of a vector field
that is normal to a surface mutliplied by the surface area. Before
discussing how to find the part of a vector that is normal to a
surface we will first look at surface area. In particular, we will
examine how to find the surface area that is formed by rotating a
curve around an axis.

\subsection{Areas of Revolution}
One way to form a surface is to take a curve and rotate it around some
axis. This process can be thought of as taking a string and
``twirling'' it around the axis, just like swinging a jump rope. For
example, one way to form a sphere is to take half of a circular
``hoop'' and spin it around an axis (see Figure
\ref{flux:figure:circle}) Another example is a cylinder which can be
formed by rotating a straight, horizontal line around an axis.

\begin{figure}[ht]

       \draw (5.5,0) circle (0.2 and 1);
       \draw[densely dashed] (3.5,1) arc (90:-90:.2 and 1);
      \end{tikzpicture}

  \caption{A half circle can be rotated around the $x$-axis to form a
    sphere. A straight, horizontal line can also be rotated around the
    $x$-axis to form a cylinder.}
  \label{flux:figure:circle}
\end{figure}

Other curves can be rotated around the axis, and the question is how
to find the resulting surface area given a formula for the curve.  The
basic idea to find the surface area of such a surface is to divide up
the original curve into small pieces, revolve each little piece around
the axis, and then add up the surface areas for all of the little
pieces.

\end{figure}


For the general case, a curve given by $y=f(x)$\ is rotated around the
$x$-axis from $x=a$\ to $x=b$, and the resulting surface area will be
found.  The first step is to break up the curve into small pieces. In
order to take advantage of the fundamental theorem of calculus, the
\textbf{domain} will have to be divided up into small pieces first.
The domain, the values on the $x$-axis from $a$\ to $b$, is first
divided into small pieces of length $\triangle x$. Any segment along
the line starts at $x_n=a+n\triangle x$\ and ends at
$x_{n+1}=a+(n+1)\triangle x$ (see Figure \ref{flux:figure:Riemann}). (
The process of breaking the domain up into small pieces is called
``discretization''.)

\end{figure}

Given a formula for a line we will find the area found by revolving
the line around the $x$-axis. Since the function changes according to
some variable, $x$, we will try to express the surface area of each
little piece that is found as a function of $x$\ and mutliplied by a
$\triangle x$. If we can do this, the sum can later be expressed as an
integral. An example of one of the little pieces can be seen in Figure
\ref{flux:figure:lineSegmentDX}.

\end{center}
\caption{The area of a line segment that is rotated around the
  $x$-axis is $2\pi\frac{R_1+R_2}{2}\triangle s$.}
\label{flux:figure:lineSegment}
\end{figure}


Each little piece will be treated as a line segment of length
$\triangle s$\ that is rotated around the $x$-axis. If the distance
from the $x$-axis to the left side of the line segment is $R_1$ and
the distance from the $x$-axis to the right side of the line segment
is $R_2$, the area of the resulting surface is
$2\pi\frac{R_1+R_2}{2}\triangle s$. (See Figure
\ref{flux:figure:lineSegment}.)

Once the domain is subdivided, each straight line-segment from
$(x_n,y_n)$\ to $(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})$\ is revolved around the $x$-axis
(see Figure \ref{flux:figure:lineSegment}). The area of this one little
piece is
\begin{eqnarray*}
  2 \pi \frac{y_{n+1}+y_n}{2} \triangle s_n.
\end{eqnarray*}
The length, $\triangle s_n$, of the line segment (along the curve) can
be found through the use of the Pythagarean Theorem and is
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \triangle s_n & = & \sqrt{\lp x_{n+1}-x_n \rp^2 +
    \lp y_{n+1}-y_n \rp^2}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The notation can be simplified a bit, and the expression is factored
so that a $\triangle x_n$\ remains on the outside of the expression,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\triangle s_n  & = & \sqrt{ \triangle x_n^2 +  \triangle y_n^2}, \\
  & = & \sqrt{ 1 +  \lp \frac{\triangle y_n}{\triangle x_n} \rp^2}
  ~~ \triangle x_n.
\end{eqnarray*}
The $\triangle x_n$\ was factored out so that the whole expression can
later be written as a Riemann sum varying over the $x$\ values.

An approximation of the total surface area from $x=a$\ to $x=b$\ is
found by adding up all of the surface areas of the little pieces
together,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \sum^{N-1}_{n=0} 2 \pi \frac{y_{n+1}+y_n}{2}\triangle s_n & = &
  \sum^{N-1}_{n=0} 2 \pi \frac{y_{n+1}+y_n}{2}
  \sqrt{ 1 +  \lp \frac{\triangle y_n}{\triangle x_n} \rp^2} ~ \triangle x_n.
  \label{flux:eqn:riemann}
\end{eqnarray}
The $y$\ values are found by using the value of the function at the
points in its domain, $y_n=f(x_n)$. As the length of the line segments
get closer to zero the Riemann sum approachs an integral,
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \int^b_a 2 \pi f(x) \sqrt{1+\lp f'(x)\rp^2} ~ dx.
\end{eqnarray*}




\subsection{Area of a Sphere}
As an example, the surface area of a sphere of radius $R$\ is
found. A semi-circle, $f(x)=\sqrt{R^2-x^2}$, is rotated around the
$x$-axis. The area is given by the integral
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \int^R_{-R} 2 \pi \sqrt{R^2-x^2} \sqrt{1 + \lp
    \frac{-x}{\sqrt{R^2-x^2}} \rp^2 } ~ dx
    & = & \int^R_{-R} 2 \pi \sqrt{R^2-x^2} \sqrt{1 +
      \frac{x^2}{R^2-x^2}} ~ dx, \\
    & = & \int^R_{-R} 2 \pi \sqrt{R^2-x^2} \sqrt{
      \frac{R^2}{R^2-x^2}} ~ dx, \\
    & = & \int^R_{-R} 2 \pi R ~ dx, \\
    & = & 4 \pi R^2.
\end{eqnarray*}


\subsection{Flux Through a Surface From A Point Charge}
If a point charge is located at the origin the magnitude of the
electic field at a point, $(x,y)$, can be found using Coulomb's Law,
\begin{eqnarray*}
  |\vec{E}| & = & \frac{k\hat{q}}{x^2+y^2},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\hat{q}$\  is the total charge  of the particle. The field will
be  pointing radially away   from the origin   (or inwards if it  is a
negative charge).  To  find the  flux through  a surface  two examples
will be examined. The first is the specific case of the flux through a
cylinder, and the second situation examined is the general case of the
flux through a surface.

For negative $x$\ values the vectors for the electric field point to
the left, and for positive $x$\ values the vectors for the electric
field point to the right. The result is that the process of finding
the components of the vectors is different for negative $x$\ values
than for positive $x$\ values. We will concentrate on finding the flux
for positive $x$\ values and leave the process of finding the flux for
negative values as an exercise for the reader. (The formulas for the
flux for the negative $x$\ values is the same except that a negative
sign in front of the resulting flux is required.)

\subsection{Flux Through A Cylinder}
A straight, horizontal line that is a distance $R$\ above the $x$-axis
can be rotated around the $x$-axis to define the surface of a cylinder
whose radius is $R$. It is assumed that the line is located in the
first quadrant. To find the flux through a cylinder of radius $R$\ and
length $L$\ from a point charge at the origin, a straight, horizontal
line is divided into small pieces, each small piece is rotated around
the $x$-axis, and the flux is calculated through the resulting area
(see Figure \ref{flux:figure:lineSegmentFlux}). The total flux is
found by adding the contribution of each of the line-segments.

\caption{The flux through an area is defined to be the magnitude of
  the vector normal to the surface multiplied by the surface area.}
\label{flux:figure:lineSegmentFlux}
\end{figure}

The area of one of the small ``hoops'' is $2\pi R \triangle x$ (here
$f(x)=R$, and $f'(x)=0$), and the flux is $|\vec{E}|\cos(\phi) 2\pi R
\triangle x$. The total flux is found by adding up the flux through
each piece:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \sum^{N-1}_{n=0} |\vec{E}|\cos(\phi_n) 2\pi R \triangle x_n & = &
  \sum^{N-1}_{n=0} \frac{k\hat{q}}{x_n^2+R^2} \cos(\phi)
      2\pi R \triangle x_n.\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Assuming the line lies in the first quadrant, the cosine of $\phi$\ is
$\frac{R}{\sqrt{x_n^2+R^2}}$, and the resulting flux is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum^{N-1}_{n=0} \lp \frac{k\hat{q}}{x_n^2+R^2} \cdot
                     \frac{R}{\sqrt{x_n^2+R^2}}
      2\pi R \rp ~ \triangle x_n
  & = & \sum^{N-1}_{n=0} \lp \frac{k\hat{q}}{\lp x_n^2+R^2 \rp^{3/2}}
      2\pi R^2 \rp ~ \triangle x_n.
\end{eqnarray*}
As the length of the line-segments approaches zero the Riemann sum
approaches an integral,
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \int^L_{0} \frac{k\hat{q}}{\lp{x^2+R^2}\rp^{\frac{3}{2}}}
      2\pi R^2 ~dx.
\end{eqnarray*}

For a line segment in the second quadrant, the cosine of $\phi$\ has
the opposite sign, and the resulting integral appears to be the same
only with a negative sign in front of it.


\subsection{Flux Through A Surface of Revolution}
Finding the flux through a cylinder is made easier because the normal
to the line segment is always straight up (in the $\hat{\jmath}$\
direction). In the general case, however, the curve that is being
rotated is not necessarily a horizontal line, and the normal to the
surface can be more difficult to find. We will concentrate on finding
the portion of the electric field that is perpindicular to a straight
line-segment. Once this is found, a Riemann sum for the flux can be
found for the general problem.

\caption{The component of a vector perpindicular to a surface is the
  length of the vector multiplied by the cosine of the angle between
  the vector and the normal to the surface.}
\label{flux:figure:lineSegmentGeneralFlux}
\end{figure}

First the component of the electric field that is normal to a
line-segment is found (see Figure
\ref{flux:figure:lineSegmentGeneralFlux}). (Again, it is assumed that
the line segment is in the first quadrant.) The component of the
electric field normal to a line-segment is the length of the vector
due to the electric field mutliplied by the cosine of the angle
between a vector perpindicular to the line and the vector from the
electric field. If the angle between the normal and a horizontal line
is $\psi$\ and the angle between the electric field and a horizontal
line is $\phi$, then the angle between the normal and the electric
field is $\frac{\pi}{2}+\psi-\phi$.

The cosine of $\frac{\pi}{2}+\psi-\phi$\ can be found by looking at
each separate angle:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \cos(\frac{\pi}{2} + \psi-\phi) & = & -\sin(\psi-\phi), \\
  & = & \cos(\psi)\sin(\phi) - \sin(\psi)\cos(\phi).
\end{eqnarray*}
Since the point charge is located at the origin, the electric field is
pointing in a radial direction,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{flux:eqn:edirection}
  \cos(\phi) & = & \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}, \\
  \sin(\phi) & = & \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
To handle the angle for the normal, some information must be known
about the function. The slope of the tangent line is given by the
derivative of the function, and the normal is the vector perpindular
to the tangent line (see Figure
\ref{flux:figure:lineSegmentGeneralFlux}):
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{flux:eqn:fdirection}
  \cos(\psi) & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}}, \\
  \sin(\psi) & = & \frac{f'(x)}{\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The component of the electric field that is normal to the line segment
is
\begin{eqnarray*}
  |\vec{E}| \cos(\frac{\pi}{2} + \psi-\phi) & = &
       \frac{k\hat{q}}{x^2+y^2}
  \lp \cos(\psi)\sin(\phi) - \sin(\psi)\cos(\phi) \rp,  \\
\end{eqnarray*}
which can be expanded using equations (\ref{flux:eqn:edirection}) and
(\ref{flux:eqn:fdirection}),
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \lefteqn{ \frac{k\hat{q}}{x^2+y^2}
       \lp \cos(\psi)\sin(\phi) - \sin(\psi)\cos(\phi) \rp  ~ = } &&  \\
     & &   \frac{k\hat{q}}{x^2+f^2(x)}
     \lp \frac{f(x)}{\sqrt{x^2+f^2(x)}} \cdot
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\lp f'(x) \rp^2}} -
     \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+f^2(x)}} \cdot
     \frac{f'(x)}{\sqrt{1+\lp f'(x) \rp^2}} \rp.
\end{eqnarray*}
If the line segment is rotated around the $x$-axis the resulting flux
is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \lefteqn{|\vec{E}| \cos(\frac{\pi}{2}+\psi-\phi)
    2\pi \frac{f(x_{n+1})+f(x_n)}{2}
    \sqrt{1+ \lp f'(x_n) \rp^2}  } \\
  & = & \frac{k\hat{q}}{x_n^2+y_n^2}
  \lp \cos(\psi)\sin(\phi) - \sin(\psi)\cos(\phi) \rp
     2\pi \frac{f(x_{n+1})+f(x_n)}{2} \sqrt{1+ \lp f'(x_n) \rp^2} ~
     \triangle x_n.  \\
\end{eqnarray*}
After substituting from equations (\ref{flux:eqn:edirection}) and
(\ref{flux:eqn:fdirection}), the flux for one piece can be expressed
as
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \frac{k\hat{q}}{\lp x_n^2+f^2(x_n)\rp^{3/2} }
  \lp f(x_n) - x_n f'(x_n) \rp 2 \pi \frac{f(x_{n+1})+f(x_n)}{2} ~
  \triangle x_n.
\end{eqnarray*}

The total flux can be approximated by adding up the fluxes through
each small piece to give
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \sum_{n=0}^N \lp \frac{k\hat{q}}{\lp x_n^2+f^2(x_n)\rp^{3/2} }
  \lp f(x_n) - x_n f'(x_n) \rp 2 \pi \frac{f(x_{n+1})+f(x_n)}{2} \rp
  ~ \triangle x_n.
\end{eqnarray*}
As the length of the line segments goes to zero, the Riemann sum
approachs the integral
\begin{eqnarray*}
  k\hat{q}2\pi \int^b_a f(x)\frac{f(x)-xf'(x)}{\lp x^2+f^2(x) \rp^{3/2}}
     ~ dx & = &
     k\hat{q}2\pi \int^b_a \frac{f^2(x)-xf(x)f'(x)}{\lp x^2+f^2(x)
       \rp^{3/2}} ~ dx.
\end{eqnarray*}
An $x^3$\ can be factored from the denomintor to yield
\begin{eqnarray*}
  k\hat{q}2\pi \int^b_a \frac{f^2(x)-xf(x)f'(x)}{x^3 \lp
    1+\lp \frac{f(x)}{x} \rp^2 \rp^{3/2}} ~ dx,
\end{eqnarray*}
and the $x^3$\ can be factored into the numerator which gives
\begin{eqnarray*}
  k\hat{q}2\pi \int^b_a \frac{x^{-3}f^2(x)-x^{-2}f(x)f'(x)}{\lp
    1+\lp \frac{f(x)}{x} \rp^2 \rp^{3/2}} ~ dx.
\end{eqnarray*}
The resulting integral can be found by using $u$-substition, where
$u=\lp \frac{f(x)}{x} \rp^2$ giving
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \frac{k\hat{q}2\pi}{\sqrt{1+\lp \frac{f(x)}{x} \rp^2 }}
     \Bigg|^b_a
     & = & \frac{k\hat{q}2\pi x}{\sqrt{x^2 + f(x)^2}}
     \Bigg|^b_a.
\end{eqnarray*}
