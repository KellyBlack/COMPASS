* Make a rough sketch of an object's velocity given the graph of its
	position.

* Recognize that an object's position decreases when the velocity is
	negative.

* Recognize that an object's position increases then the velocity is
	positive.

* Recognize that a constant velocity results in a linear position
	graph.

* Identify local minima and maxima based on the change in sign of the
	velocity.

* Explain why knowing that the velocity is zero does not necessarily
	imply that the position is at a local minimum or local maximum.

* Recognize that if you are given the velocity you need to be given
	the position at one point in order to reconstruct the position of an
	object.
