Calculus One
====================

The calculus one topics focus on how to quantify change. They include
the following:

* Average Rate of Change
* Instantaneous Rate of Change

	* The Limit
	* The Definition of the Derivative
	* Derivative Rules

* Change Over An Interval

	* The Mean Value Theorem
	* Increasing/Decreasing Over an Interval
		
* Total Change

	* Total Change
	* Riemann Sums
	* The Definite Integral
	* The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The goals for each day are given below.

Kinematics
------------

Goals for day 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Determine if the change in position is positive or negative given
	the velocity.

* Make rough sketches of the position given piecewise constant
	velocities.

* Relate how the sign of the velocity impacts the change in position.

* Given a piecewise linear position determine the velocity of an
	object.

* Calculate estimates for the change in position given the velocity
	over a given set of time intervals.

* Sketch a plot of the graph of the position or the velocity given a
	written description of a situation.


Goals for day 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Determine the displacement of an object given its velocity.

* Identify the difference between distance an object travels and the
	object's displacement from a given position.

* Determine local minimums and maximums of an object's displacement
	given the velocity.

* Identify that local minimum and maximums occur when an object's
	velocity changes sign.

* Be able to calculate the average rate of change of a function over a
	given interval.

* Identify the difference between total change and average rate of
	change.

* Determine the displacement over a time interval given the average
	rate of change.

* Determine whether or not displacement is negative or positive given
	the average rate of change.

* Determine  whether or not the average rate of change is positive or
	negative given the displacement.

* Relate the average rate of change with the slope of the secant line.

* Determine a sequence of average rates of changes over smaller
	intervals chosen by the student.
