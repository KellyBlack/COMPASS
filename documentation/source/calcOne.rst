Calculus One
====================

The calculus one topics focus on how to quantify change. They include
the following:

* Average Rate of Change
* Instantaneous Rate of Change

	* The Limit
	* The Definition of the Derivative
	* Derivative Rules

* Change Over An Interval

	* The Mean Value Theorem
	* Increasing/Decreasing Over an Interval
		
* Total Change

	* Total Change
	* Riemann Sums
	* The Definite Integral
	* The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The goals for each day are given below.

Kinematics
------------

Goals for day 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Determine if the change in position is positive or negative given
	the velocity.

* Make rough sketches of the position given piecewise constant
	velocities.

* Relate how the sign of the velocity impacts the change in position.

* Given a piecewise linear position determine the velocity of an
	object.

* Calculate estimates for the change in position given the velocity
	over a given set of time intervals.

* Sketch a plot of the graph of the position or the velocity given a
	written description of a situation.
