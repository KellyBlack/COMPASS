Kinematics
------------

Goals for activity  1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Determine if the change in position is positive or negative given
	the velocity.

* Make rough sketches of the position given piecewise constant
	velocities.

* Relate how the sign of the velocity impacts the change in position.

* Given a piecewise linear position determine the velocity of an
	object.

* Calculate estimates for the change in position given the velocity
	over a given set of time intervals.

* Sketch a plot of the graph of the position or the velocity given a
	written description of a situation.


Goals for activity  2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Determine the displacement of an object given its velocity.

* Identify the difference between distance an object travels and the
	object's displacement from a given position.

* Determine local minimums and maximums of an object's displacement
	given the velocity.

* Identify that local minimum and maximums occur when an object's
	velocity changes sign.

* Be able to calculate the average rate of change of a function over a
	given interval.

* Identify the difference between total change and average rate of
	change.

* Determine the displacement over a time interval given the average
	rate of change.

* Determine whether or not displacement is negative or positive given
	the average rate of change.

* Determine  whether or not the average rate of change is positive or
	negative given the displacement.

* Relate the average rate of change with the slope of the secant line.

* Determine a sequence of average rates of changes over smaller
	intervals chosen by the student.


Goals for activity  3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Compute the average rate of change of a function over an arbitary
	interval.

* Construct a sequence of intervals whose width gets close to zero and
	approximate the average rate of change over each interval.

* State the difference between the total change and average rate of
	change over an interval.

* Demonstrate that the average rate of change gets close to a specific
	value for a low order polynomial when the width of the interval gets
	closer to zero.

* Calculate the instantaneous rate of change of a low order polynomial
	at an arbitrary value of time.

* Identify the relationship between the instantaneous rate of change
	and the slope of the tangent line.


Goals for activity  4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Determine the derivative of a low order polynomial using the
	definition of the derivative.

* Determine the derivative of the square root using the definition of
	the derivative and the conjugate of the numerator.

* Determine the slope of the tangent line of a low order polynomial.


Goals for activity  5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Make a rough sketch of an object's position given the graph of its velocity.

* Make a rough sketch of an object's velocity given the graph of its
	position.

* Recognize that an object's position decreases when the velocity is
	negative.

* Recognize that an object's position increases then the velocity is
	positive.

* Recognize that a constant velocity results in a linear position
	graph.

* Identify local minima and maxima based on the change in sign of the
	velocity.

* Explain why knowing that the velocity is zero does not necessarily
	imply that the position is at a local minimum or local maximum.

* Recognize that if you are given the velocity you need to be given
	the position at one point in order to reconstruct the position of an
	object. 



Goals for activity  6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Use the power rool to determine the derivative of a function.

* Use the poer rule to determine the anti-derivative of a function.

* Recognize that the anti-derivative cannot be uniquely determined.

* Determine the anti-derivative of a function given one value of the
	anti-derivative at a pre-determined point. (Solve for the constant
	that results from determining the anti-derivative.)
